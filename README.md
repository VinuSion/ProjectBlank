# Blank's UI Kit - Tests & Prototypes [Front-End]

## Setup
1. Make a folder and place all of the files you downloaded there. (Chances are the folder will be already made)
2. Go into VS Code and make that folder your Workspace.
3. Run this command to install the necessary Node Modules:
```
npm install
```

### Running
You may use the Vue Web GUI to "run serve" the program (if you know how to)

If not, then just run this command in the Terminal:
```
npm run serve
```
